# Simple script on the Linux side to feed the Xmod's Line-in (from the Mac) to the PC's built-in Line-out (to the stereo system)
# until I either get a proper hardware solution (a mixer) or a proper PulseAudio client on the Mac side
#
# NOTE: padsp has no effect; you have to use pamon/pacat's own -n option
#
# NOTE: There's a 5-second delay; I don't know why. --latency-msec=1 doesn't seem to make a difference;
# I tried adding dd to the pipe but that's not it either (it probably makes things worse but in reality there's no difference).
